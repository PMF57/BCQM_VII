# CSV artefacts

This folder contains consolidated analysis outputs used by the BCQM VII paper and its figures.

General rule:
- If it is plotted in a figure or quoted in a table, it should be traceable to a CSV under `csv/`.

Key subfolders:
- `pivot_base/` — ball-growth exponent runs/summary (Test 2.4)
- `curvature/` — curvature proxy summaries (Test 2.3)
- `spectral_dim/` — spectral dimension curves/summaries (Test 2.1; optional/finite-size dominated)
- `gate4/` — localisation / hop-distance summaries (Gate 4 / Test 3.1)
- `gateA3_N16/`, `gateA3_N32/` — scale-up run summaries

See `docs/EVIDENCE_MANIFEST.md` for the authoritative mapping from CSVs to claims/figures.
