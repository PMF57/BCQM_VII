# Provenance

This folder is reserved for provenance notes and trimming manifests.

Typical contents:
- hashes / checksums for baseline code state
- notes about which artefacts were trimmed from a release ZIP
- links or references to any separate run-output archives (if you later publish `outputs_cloth/`)

If you publish a trimmed Zenodo record, record the trim decision here and keep it consistent with `docs/EVIDENCE_MANIFEST.md`.
