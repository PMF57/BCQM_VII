# Documentation (BCQM VII)

This folder contains the audit trail for BCQM VII Stage–2.

Start here:
- `EVIDENCE_MANIFEST.md` — authoritative index of runs, CSV artefacts, scripts, and figure PDFs
- `BCQM_VII_PathA_Validation_TestPlan_Beyond_Stability9_*.tex/.pdf` — validation plan with current status

Lab notes:
- `Lab Notes/` contains stage checkpoints and lab-note snapshots supporting the Gate/test results.
- `Lab Notes/checkpoints/` contains the gate-specific lab notes (Test 2.4, 2.3, 2.1, repeatability, etc.).

If you add new runs or regenerate figures, update:
- `EVIDENCE_MANIFEST.md`
- (optionally) the validation plan progress paragraph
